# GeekPeek

GeekPeek is a React.js project that allows users to search for movies and play their trailers. It utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data and trailers. With GeekPeek, you can easily find information about your favorite movies and watch their trailers without leaving the application.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title, keyword, or any other relevant information. Get detailed information about the movies, including the title, release date, overview, and poster.

- **Movie Trailers**: Watch trailers of the selected movies. GeekPeek provides an embedded video player for a seamless viewing experience.
